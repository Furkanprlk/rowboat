# Intro #
We have three planes/dimensions for the Android testing:
  * **[SimpleTests](SimpleTests.md)**
  * **[Benchmarks](Benchmarks.md)**
  * **[StressTest](StressTest.md)**

"[SimpleTests](SimpleTests.md)" consists of two parts:
  * Tests designed by Google and shipped with their Android's source code
  * Google Android CTS
  * Manual testing - group of test cases which is not automated

"[Benchmarks](Benchmarks.md)" are designed to measure 2D, 3D, CPU, Java and JavaScript and overall system performance covering miscellaneous areas (browser, network, data processing).

"[StressTest](StressTest.md)" is simple monkey test.
