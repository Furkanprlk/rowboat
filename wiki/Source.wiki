== Host Setup to download the sources ==

Before you download the source, you will need [http://git-scm.com/ git] and [http://source.android.com/source/git-repo.html repo] tools.

On an Ubuntu 8.04 host, you can do the following:

Getting git:
{{{
$ sudo apt-get install git-core
}}}

Getting repo:
{{{
$ curl http://android.git.kernel.org/repo >~/bin/repo
$ chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
}}}

You can find detailed repo installing instructions [http://source.android.com/source/git-repo.html here]

==To download the rowboat source code==

Kindly follow the below instructions to download the sources

{{{
$ mkdir ~/rowboat-android
$ cd ~/rowboat-android
$ repo init -u git://gitorious.org/rowboat/manifest.git -m ManifestName
$ repo sync
}}}

Where _!ManifestName_ is:
 * _rowboat-donut.xml_ - for donut version of rowboat
 * _rowboat-donut-dsp.xml_ - for donut version of rowboat with DSP support
 * _rowboat-eclair.xml_ - for eclair version of rowboat
 * _rowboat-eclair-dsp.xml_ - for eclair version of rowboat with DSP support
 * _rowboat-froyo.xml_ - for froyo version of rowboat
