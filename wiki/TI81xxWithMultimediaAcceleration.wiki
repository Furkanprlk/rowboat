This document explains how to build and run Android Gingerbread on TI816x and TI814x with support Multimedia and DSP acceleration.

These instructions have been tested with a fresh installation of Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.  Some steps might be slightly different for other Linux distributions or different Ubuntu versions.

= Initializing Your Build Environment =

Many of the steps in this section are based on instructions in this document:  [http://source.android.com/source/initializing.html]

== Installing Needed Ubuntu Packages ==

For a 64-bit Ubuntu installation, run the following commands:

{{{
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-software-properties git-core gnupg flex bison \
  gperf build-essential zip curl zlib1g-dev libc6-dev lib32ncurses5-dev   \
  ia32-libs x11proto-core-dev libx11-dev lib32readline5-dev lib32z1-dev   \
  libgl1-mesa-dev g++-multilib mingw32 tofrodos corkscrew
}}}

For a 32-bit Ubuntu installation, run the following commands *(UNVERIFIED)*:

{{{
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-software-properties git-core gnupg flex bison \
  gperf build-essential zip curl zlib1g-dev libc6-dev libncurses5-dev     \
  x11proto-core-dev libx11-dev libreadline5-dev libz-dev libgl1-mesa-dev  \
  g++-multilib mingw32 tofrodos corkscrew
}}}


== Installing the JDK ==

Run the following commands:

{{{
sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://archive.canonical.com/ lucid partner"
sudo add-apt-repository "deb-src http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu lucid partner"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk
}}}

= Downloading the Source =

Many of the steps in this section are based on instructions in this document:  [http://source.android.com/source/downloading.html]

== Proxy Settings ==

If you are behind a proxy, you need to run the following commands to access the external rowboat repositories.  Replace {{{<http proxy server>:<port>}}} with the name of your http proxy server and proxy port, and configure your https and ftp proxy servers in a similar fashion.

{{{
export http_proxy=<http proxy server>:<port>
export https_proxy=<https proxy server>:<port>
export ftp_proxy=<ftp proxy server>:<port>

cat > ~/git-proxy.sh <<END
#!/bin/sh

CS=/usr/bin/corkscrew
PROXY_HOST=<http proxy server>
PROXY_PORT=<port>

exec \${CS} \${PROXY_HOST} \${PROXY_PORT} \$*
END
export GIT_PROXY_COMMAND=${HOME}/git-proxy.sh
chmod a+x ~/git-proxy.sh
}}}

== Install Repo ==

Run the following commands:

{{{
mkdir ~/bin
PATH=~/bin:$PATH
curl https://android.git.kernel.org/repo > ~/bin/repo
chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
}}}

== Download the Source ==
{{{
mkdir ~/rowboat-android
cd ~/rowboat-android
repo init -u git://gitorious.org/rowboat/manifest.git -m rowboat-gingerbread-ti81xx-mc-dsp.xml
repo sync
}}}
